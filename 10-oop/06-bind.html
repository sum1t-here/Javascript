    // Using .call(this) in the Event Listener (as demonstrated by React1 class):
    // This approach immediately invokes the handleClick1 method with the context (this) provided.
    // In this case, you're not binding the method to the instance as in the previous example.

<!-- this.handleClick.bind(this) is used to ensure that the this keyword inside the event listener (handleClick method) refers to the correct object, specifically the instance of the React class. -->
<!-- Here's why bind is used and what it does:

Maintaining the Correct Context: JavaScript uses a dynamic context for the this keyword. In event listeners like the one you have, this will typically refer to the DOM element that triggered the event (in this case, the <button> element). To ensure that this inside the handleClick method still points to the React instance, you use bind(this).

Creating a New Function: The bind method creates a new function that, when called, has its this value set to the provided value (in this case, the React instance). It doesn't immediately invoke the function; it returns a new function with the specified this context. -->

<!-- when the button is clicked, the event listener triggers the handleClick method, and because of bind(this), this inside handleClick remains bound to the React instance. This allows you to access the React instance's properties and methods within the event handler.

Without bind(this), this would refer to the <button> element, which is not what you want in this context. By using bind(this), you ensure that the context of this is correctly set to the instance of the React class. -->

<!-- You can use the `call` method to change the context (the value of `this`) in a JavaScript function, just like `bind`. However, there's a key difference between `call` and `bind`:

1. **`bind` returns a new function**: When you use `bind`, it creates a new function with the specified context (`this` value) and doesn't immediately invoke the function. You can call this new function later.

2. **`call` immediately invokes the function**: When you use `call`, it changes the context and immediately invokes the function with the new `this` value.

In your specific case, when setting up an event listener, it's common to use `bind` because you want to pass a function reference to the event listener, not the result of the function's execution. You want the function to be executed later when the event occurs.

Using `call` in this context would not be suitable because it would immediately execute the function instead of waiting for the button click event. Here's an example of how you would use `call`, which is not appropriate for event listeners:

```javascript
document
  .querySelector('button')
  .addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.call(this));
```

With the above code, `this.handleClick.call(this)` would immediately execute `handleClick` with the provided context, not when the button is clicked.

So, in your scenario, you should use `bind` to create a new function with the correct context that can be executed later when the button is clicked. -->
